description: Search Trip.com through the trip MCP tools and present the results as compact deal cards. Use search_flights for cheap flights and fare calendars on a route, search_hotels for hotel recommendations with stay, price, property, room, payment, meal, rating, distance or sort preferences, and search_attractions for attraction tickets, day tours and local experiences, and travel services such as airport transfers, pocket Wi-Fi and SIM cards. Do not use for trains, car rentals, cruises or visas. The tools only search; booking and payment happen on the linked Trip.com page.

# Trip.com deals

The `trip` MCP server searches Trip.com and returns normalized results. This skill owns routing, parameter collection and presentation; the tools own retrieval, validation and normalization. Results come with partner tracking already applied to every link.

| User intent | Tool | Key arguments |
|---|---|---|
| Flights, fares, cheap tickets on a route | `search_flights` | `departCityCode`, `startDate`, optional `arrivalCityCode` |
| Hotels and other stays | `search_hotels` | `cityName`, country, `latitude`, `longitude` |
| Attraction tickets | `search_attractions` | `productType: "ticket"`, `cityName` |
| Day tours, local experiences | `search_attractions` | `productType: "play_experience"`, `cityName` |
| Airport transfers, pickup, pocket Wi-Fi, SIM cards | `search_attractions` | `productType: "play_travel_tool"`, `cityName`; pass `excludeSim: false` when the user wants SIM cards |
| Show the chosen results as Trip.com cards | `show_results` | `requestIds` of the searches to show (see Result cards) |

The tools only search: they book nothing and take no payment or personal details, and every result links to Trip.com. When the user only wants options, stop at the results; the user books on Trip.com. When the user asks you to book or pay, this skill does not restrict it. Book only a result the user has chosen; if they have not chosen one, show the results and ask which to book. Open that result's link and continue there with the available browser and payment workflows, following their confirmation and data-handling rules. The booking page reprices: before submitting traveller details or paying, tell the user the page's final price (noting any difference from the card or their budget), the flight or room being booked and its change and cancellation terms. Never book a mock result.

## Language

- Infer the reply language from the current user request without asking and pass it as `language` on every call, so a language change takes effect immediately.
- For Simplified Chinese pass `zh-CN`; the tool queries the backend with `zh-HK` content unless `locale` is given. For other languages use the matching BCP 47 code, such as `en-US` or `ja-JP`. If the language cannot be inferred, use `zh-HK`.
- Write surrounding prose and template labels in the reply language. Preserve returned product titles, route titles and promotion text verbatim.
- Pass `currency` on every call: it sets the returned prices and the currency the Trip.com booking page settles in. Use the currency the user names or will pay in (for example, the only currency their payment method supports); otherwise the currency of the user's country or region; `USD` when neither is known.

## Results and errors

Every tool returns JSON. A success is `{ requestId, deals, ... }`; a failure is `{ requestId, error: { code, message, retryable, fields? }, deals: [] }`.

- Explain `error.message` in the reply language without exposing `error.code`, `requestId`, field paths or raw JSON. Suggest retrying later only when `retryable` is true; otherwise ask for the corrected input, using `error.fields` to name only the values that need correction.
- `trip_api_not_configured` means the Trip.com service is not available in this environment yet; say so plainly and do not retry.
- `tool_disabled` means this kind of Trip.com search is switched off for now; say it is temporarily unavailable and do not retry it.
- A success with an empty `deals` list means nothing matched, not that the service failed. Do not call `show_results`. Say no Trip.com results matched and suggest relaxing the most restrictive condition the user set (non-stop, airline, cabin, price, free cancellation, distance, dates); search again only if the user agrees.
- Never expose tool names, arguments, city codes, internal IDs or raw JSON to the user, except in mock mode below.
- **Mock mode.** A result with a `debug` object comes from sample data, not Trip.com. Start the reply with one line `> 🧪 Debug (mock): {debug.note}` translated into the reply language, then handle the result as usual: render the cards with the normal templates (keep the `[MOCK]` titles), or explain `error` as above. Only when `debug.trip_request` is present, end with the heading "Trip request (debug)" and `debug.trip_request` as a fenced JSON block. Never present mock results as real offers or prices.
- **Result cards.** Searches never show cards. A search with deals returns its `requestId` and `card_ready: true`. First check the results answer the request (for hotels, that they are near the intended place; if they are clearly elsewhere, check the coordinates and search again, ignoring the wrong results). Then call `show_results` once with the `requestId` of the searches to show, normally the last good search. Several `requestId`s from the same tool, such as flight searches per arrival code, are merged into one card; call it once per tool when the user asked for different kinds of deals. Never show results you replaced with a new search, and never call `show_results` twice for the same results.
- After `show_results` returns `card_shown: true`, the user sees the deals as Trip.com cards (a horizontally scrollable row with image, price and a Book link). Do not repeat them as markdown cards or lists. Reply with at most two short sentences: the useful selection sentence from the [display rules](references/display.md) and, for hotels, the note that the final total, room type, payment terms and cancellation deadline are confirmed on the Trip.com room page. Refer to deals by their exact titles.
- If `show_results` fails with `results_not_found`, search again once and show the new `requestId`. For any other failure, or results you chose not to show, render every deal individually with its product template and the [compact-card rules](references/display.md). Do not rewrite titles, replace them with labels such as "Option 1", or summarize several deals into a list.
- Render prices, currencies and savings exactly as returned. Never calculate, convert or invent a price, discount or saving, and never add a per-night, per-person, tax, fee or round-trip basis the result does not state.
- Make one search per request unless a rule below says otherwise; do not make extra searches to fill cards or the selection sentence.

## Trip timing

Apply these rules whenever flights and a stay are planned together, or a stay length is judged from flight times.

- A hotel night runs from the afternoon check-in (usually 14:00–15:00) to the next morning's checkout (usually 11:00–12:00), in the hotel's local time. Count a stay in hotel nights (check-out date minus check-in date), never in calendar days spent at the destination.
- A flight landing after midnight still needs the room from the night before: the check-in date is the day before the landing date (landing 00:55 on 10 Oct means checking in on 9 Oct). Tell the user the room is booked from the night of arrival so it is held for a late check-in. Such an arrival gives the same number of nights as an evening arrival on the previous day; never reject it as a night short.
- "3 days 2 nights" means two hotel nights between the outbound arrival and the return departure. A late-evening or after-midnight arrival and a return departing after the morning checkout both fit it.
- Flight times are local at each airport; `+1` marks arrival on the next local day. Do not convert time zones when matching flights to a stay.
- When pairing flights with a hotel search, derive `checkIn` and `checkOut` from the flight times with these rules, and state the check-in date whenever it differs from the landing date.

## Flights

Search Trip.com flight options for a route from a recent fare cache: each result is one bookable itinerary with times, airports, duration and price. Results come in Trip.com's recommended order, not sorted by price: keep that order and do not call a result the cheapest unless the returned prices show it.

- Pass both departure and arrival three-letter codes; they must differ. Each code is a city or metro area by default (`SHA` = all Shanghai airports); set `departureType` / `arrivalType` to `AIRPORT` when the user names an exact airport (`AIRPORT: SHA` = Hongqiao, `AIRPORT: PVG` = Pudong). A code with the `CITY` type must be a city or metro-area code: many airport codes differ from their city's code (Baku `BAK`, not `GYD`; Tokyo `TYO`, not `NRT`/`HND`; Sapporo `SPK`, not `CTS`; Xi'an `SIA`, not `XIY`), so use the city code, or keep the airport code and set its type to `AIRPORT`. A destination is required: if the user gives none, ask for it.
- If the destination maps to several city codes, call `search_flights` once per arrival code concurrently and merge the deals before rendering; show them with one `show_results` call listing every `requestId`.
- `startDate` and `endDate` bound the departure date (at most 7 days counting both, `endDate` defaults to `startDate`); `endDate` is never a return date. For round trips pass `tripType: RT` and `returnStartDate` (optional `returnEndDate`, also at most 7 days). `returnStartDate` cannot be earlier than the last departure date: for "any day next week, back two days later", search each departure date with its own return date instead of overlapping ranges. Split a departure window longer than 7 days into several searches.
- If Trip.com rejects a code (`INVALID_REQUEST` naming `departCityCode` / `arrivalCityCode`) and the code is not the main airport's own IATA code, search once more with that airport code and the `AIRPORT` type (Casablanca: `CMN`, not `CAS`). If it already is, Trip.com does not cover that airport: say so and offer a nearby hub. Never retry the same code with the other type.
- Passengers default to 1 adult, 0 children, 0 infants; pass the actual counts when known (adults plus children at most 9, infants at most adults). `limit` is 1 to 20, default 5.
- `classType` is `Y` (economy), `W` (premium economy), `C` (business) or `F` (first). `isDirectOnly: true` returns non-stop flights only; omit it to allow connections. Red-eye filtering is not available. `airlineCode` filters both directions.

Card fields: required `title`, `departureDate`, `tripType`, `bookingLinks`, `currentPrice`, `currency`, `priceBasis`, `journeys`; optional `returnDate`, `discountLabel`, `airlineName`, `flightNumbers`, `cabinLabel`, `nonstopLabel`, `originalPrice`, `savingsAmount`, `cacheUpdatedAt`. Each journey carries its departure and arrival airports, local times, duration and connection count. Keep flights without a discount or original price, and never borrow facts from another result.

- `priceBasis: ADULT_UNIT_PRICE` means the price is per adult, not the total for every passenger and not proof of taxes included.
- **Prices are cached.** Flight cards already carry the note that fares change often and the booking page shows the final price, so do not repeat it after `show_results` succeeds. When flights are rendered as text instead, add that note as one short sentence in the reply language; with the `CACHED_FARES` warning it is mandatory. The Book link opens booking and repricing; it does not reserve a seat.
- For the link use `bookingLinks.online`, otherwise `bookingLinks.h5`; keep the URL intact.

```text
✈️ **{title}** · {departure_summary} · {trip_type_label}
**{currency} {currentPrice}** {price_basis_label} · 🏷️ **{discount_summary}**
{original_price_label} ~~{currency} {originalPrice}~~ · {savings_summary}
{airlineName} {flightNumbers} · {times_and_duration} · {nonstopLabel} · {cabinLabel} · [{view_details_label}]({booking_link})
```

- Keep the route and actual departure date (and return date for round trips) on the first line; retain the year when needed to avoid ambiguity. Translate `OW` / `RT` into a one-way / round-trip label and the per-adult basis into the reply language.
- Use the returned `discountLabel` as `{discount_summary}`; if absent, omit the offer and icon. If neither reference price nor savings is present, omit the whole third line.
- Bold only the route title, current price and returned discount. Join `flightNumbers` in their returned order with `, `. `{times_and_duration}` is the outbound departure and arrival time (mark a next-day arrival) and duration. A missing non-stop label does not establish a connection. The link label should mean "View flight".
- In the selection sentence, identify a choice by route, departure date and time, adding airline or flight numbers only to distinguish otherwise identical choices.

## Hotels

Search and recommend Trip.com hotels. Read [references/hotel-search.md](references/hotel-search.md) before applying any optional filter, sort or page control.

### Destination

`destinationType`, `cityName` and the country are required on every search. Choose the type from what scopes the stay:

- `CITY`: the user wants a hotel anywhere in the city, or only names the city. Pass the city in `cityName`; no coordinates and no `name`. Trip.com ranks the whole city, which recommends better than a point at the city centre.
- `HOTEL`: the user names a specific hotel. Pass its name in `name` as the user wrote it or as officially spelled, and its city in `cityName`; no coordinates.
- `POI`: the user wants to stay near a specific place (a station, airport terminal, landmark, venue, address or district). Pass the place's `latitude`/`longitude` and its name in `name`, which labels the distance texts. Keep that place; never broaden it to the city or replace it with a nearby peer.

For `POI` coordinates, pass WGS84 decimal degrees (the GPS system used by OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia) everywhere, including mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau; the tool converts them where Trip.com needs another system. Use coordinates you know precisely for well-known places; otherwise look the place up first (for example with a web search) and take the point from a WGS84 source. Never use points from Amap (Gaode), Baidu, Tencent Maps or Google Maps inside mainland China, which are shifted by several hundred metres. Never invent, approximate or reuse another place's coordinates.

- Put the containing city in `cityName` so results stay within it, and pass the country or region as `countryName` (any language, e.g. `Japan`, `中国`, `Hong Kong`) or `countryCode` (e.g. `JP`, `CN`, `HK`; prefer the name, and use `UK`, not `GB`). It also disambiguates cities such as Sydney or London.
- `distanceKm` and the distance sorts only work with `POI`; for "near X" requests, search `POI` at X.
- Trip.com knows cities, not every resort area, beach town or neighbourhood. For places such as Seminyak, Uluwatu or Zahara de los Atunes, search `POI` with the place's coordinates and `name`, and put the city or region Trip.com lists them under in `cityName` (Bali; Barbate or Cádiz). If a `CITY` search returns `DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND`, retry this way once.
- If the city, place or hotel is missing or ambiguous, ask one focused clarification question. Never guess IDs or child ages.

### Stay and filters

- Dates use `YYYY-MM-DD`; check-out must be later than check-in. Always pass both `checkIn` and `checkOut`: when the user gives no dates, use tomorrow and the following day in the user's local date. The tool's own fallback runs on the server clock and can be off by a day.
- `roomCount` and `adults` are positive integers with adults not below rooms; defaults are 1 room and 2 adults. Every child needs an age from 0 through 17 in `childAges`. Do not convert twin beds into two rooms or a bed count.
- Trip.com cannot filter by number of beds, bathrooms or homestay bedrooms; say so when asked and point the user to the room details on the booking page. Pass `meals` as one value unless the user accepts alternatives, and never combine a meal with its own variants (`BREAKFAST` with `ONE_BREAKFAST`).
- `sortOrder` matters only for `PRICE` (`ASC` = cheapest first, the default); every other sort has a fixed direction.
- Omit optional filters and sort the user did not request, and do not silently drop unsupported or conflicting ones. The default `pageSize` is 5; pass another value from 1 through 20 only when the user asks. Omit `pageIndex` for the first page.

### Conversation modes

Use `progressive` by default and keep the selected mode for later hotel searches in the conversation.

- `progressive`: search as soon as the destination is usable, including any supported values already supplied. After the results ask at most one concise follow-up about a relevant unresolved or invalid preference.
- `confirm-first`: preview the destination (city, place or hotel), dates, occupancy, filters, sort and page size, recommending tomorrow, the following day, 1 room, 2 adults, no children and no optional filters where the user said nothing. Search after the user confirms or corrects it in one reply.

When the user switches modes, apply the new mode immediately. If they only ask to compare modes, explain the timing trade-off and ask which to use without searching.

At the first actual hotel search in a conversation, show one natural-language example of a richer search following [references/hotel-query-examples.md](references/hotel-query-examples.md): after the results when searching now (first stating any default dates and occupancy used), or after the question when a clarification blocks the search. Show it once per conversation, never on refinements, pagination, retries or language changes, and not when the user wants results only.

### Pagination

Fetch one page per search. When the user asks for more, repeat the confirmed query with `pageIndex` incremented (an initial query without an index is page 1) and the same `pageSize`. Stop when a page returns nothing or the cumulative count reaches `pagination.totalCount`.

### Hotel cards

A success also contains `searchContext`, `appliedFilters`, `pagination`, optional `sort` and `warnings`. Deal fields: required `product_type`, `title`, `category_label`, `deeplink`; optional `star`, `star_type`, `rating`, `rating_scale`, `rating_label`, `review_count`, `address`, `destination_city`, `relative_position`, `availability_status`, `availability_text`, `price`, `discount`, `promotion_label`.

```text
**{title}**
💰 **{current_price_label} {price.currency} {price.display_price}** · {original_price_label} ~~{price.currency} {price.original_price}~~ · 🏷️ **{discount_summary}** · **{savings_summary}** · [{view_details_label}]({deeplink})
{star_description} · {rating}/{rating_scale} {rating_label} · {review_count_label} · {availability_summary}
📍 {address}{relative_position_separator}{relative_position}
```

- `price.display_price` is the current displayed price and `price.original_price` the displayed comparison price; `price.savings_amount` is the saving against it. If `display_price` is absent, keep the link and any offer without inventing a price.
- A `discount.ratio` between 0 and 1 gives `{discount_summary}` as the localized equivalent of `{discount.percent}% off`, without recomputing it. Otherwise use `promotion_label` verbatim, or omit the offer and icon. Never infer a discount from labels, promotion text or the price difference.
- Interpret `star` with `star_type`: `STAR` is a star rating and `DIAMOND` a diamond rating; for any other type, including `DOT`, omit `{star_description}`. Render `rating` against `rating_scale` only when both are present; never assume a 10-point scale.
- For `AVAILABLE`, say the hotel is currently bookable and include any `availability_text` once. For another status, say so and do not present the hotel as a primary recommendation. An absent status is unknown.
- Use `address`, falling back to `destination_city`; add the relative-position separator only when both location fragments exist.
- Hotel prices are tax-inclusive by default: the total for the stay, or per night when the user set a budget; `appliedFilters.priceDisplay` states which. Whenever a hotel price appears in text, give its basis (total for N nights, or per night) and whether taxes are included; never present a pre-tax or nightly price as the amount to pay. Use pre-tax prices only when the user asks for them, and say so.
- After the cards, state once that the final tax-inclusive total, room type, payment terms and any free-cancellation deadline must be confirmed on the Trip.com room page. The search returns hotel-level prices; filters such as payment type or breakfast do not establish the terms of a specific room rate.
- Treat `warnings` as diagnostics; mention one only when it materially changes a requested filter.

## Attraction tickets, experiences and travel services

`search_attractions` searches Trip.com's discounted product pool in a city. Pass the destination city name in the user's language or English, never a code or numeric ID, and add its country as `countryName` whenever the city name could exist in more than one country (`countryCode` only as a fallback). `limit` defaults to 3. SIM-card products are excluded unless `excludeSim` is false. Sold-out items are excluded and results are sorted by discount strength.

Card fields: required `product_type`, `title`, `category_label`, `current_price`, `currency`, `deeplink`; optional `original_price`, `savings_amount`, `discount_label`, `valid_until`, `promo_tag`, `destination_city`, `redemption_note`.

```text
**{title}** · {category_label}
💰 **{currency} {current_price}** · {original_price_label} ~~{currency} {original_price}~~ · 🏷️ **{discount_summary}** · **{savings_summary}** · [{view_details_label}]({deeplink})
📍 {destination_city}
{promo_tag} · {valid_until_label} {valid_until}
```

- Use the returned `discount_label` as `{discount_summary}`, falling back to `promo_tag` when it describes an actual offer; if neither is present, omit the offer and icon. Do not repeat a `promo_tag` already used as the offer; keep distinct promotion and validity text in normal weight and omit an empty line.
- Append `redemption_note` to the destination line only when it adds information beyond the title (ignoring whitespace, line wrapping and Markdown decoration).
- Translate `valid_until_label`, `original_price_label` and `view_details_label` into the reply language.
